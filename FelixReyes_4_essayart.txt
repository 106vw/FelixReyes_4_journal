in my art project i decided to mkae a house with a human like figyure to the left of the house i am building in the canvas, this afrt project i am working on consists of many methods as the name of the project describes it "methodmadness" 
. my facorite part of this project is the chosing of colors. I want to start of with describing why my background is black and how its black; i made my canvas 300x300 and i asked my techer how to make the canvas black he siad to ake a shape the same size of my canvas and make the figure black, 
so i made a a square 300x300 and filled the shape with the color black. i chose black because i wanted my colors to stand out like the stars wich are going to be white and my house that is going to be light khaki and the roof of the house being a very dark maroon. the human like figure i am going to be placing gto the left of the house is going to be looking like a regular human being a white looking guy. i make these shapes by making a new void for every other figure or a set of figures.
