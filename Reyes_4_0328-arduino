the for loops are the same in both coding languages.arduino is very simple and easier to read. C can be used for alot more things there codes are more complex.
I have not made any but i will try to sometime this week (like today)
Power is required for a circuit.
code is compiled by avr-gcc. 


One of my favorite projects I accomplished with the arduino program was the blinking LED.
It was a very simple project, I followed the book instructions and was able to learn.
The project consists of 3 jumper wires 2 of the wires are for the positive and negative charges.
The 3rd wire is what brings the power into the bread bored. The 330 resistor allows the power to flow from one side to the other.
