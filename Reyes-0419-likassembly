the simmiliraties I noticed where that its very simple, the code does exactly what it sais.
it is all in the order that its suppose to be.

some differences were that the assembly looks alot more like an actual coding program should look,
the coding was more easier and fun but in reality they ar the same, but you have to write the code in one of the programs
HRM has the code written for you all you have to do is drag in the right order
