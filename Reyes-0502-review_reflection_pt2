        board[8][8] = '.';
        board[9][9] = '.';
        board[startX][startY] = '@';
        for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) {
                if (j < board[1].length - 1) {
                    if (board[i][j] != '@') {
                        System.out.print(".");
                    } else {
                        System.out.print(board[i][j]);
                    }
                } else {
                    if (board[i][j] != 'x') {
                        System.out.println(".");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(board[i][j]);
