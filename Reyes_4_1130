i was very succesful with my game, i felt like a advanced alot by getting help from my classmates and them walking me throught it, after a 2 examples of my classmates showing me how to do it i got back on track and accomplished a game.
In what way?
In thtis game i learned how to fix mothods to connect to one another how make a so called link. After that my game worked properly.
