Cs is a very fun and challenging subject to learn, I believe students are encouraged because it is a challenge.
Our human reflex in this world is to take a challenge and complete or try to complete. 
thatr is why students are encouraged to take cs.

Students should learn cs because that way youll make your own program and also in my case 
i am learning cs because the work field of computers will never go down. for example someone creates a 
program that runs programs but then someone would have to code that program to run with the other programns it is a never ending programing loop.
