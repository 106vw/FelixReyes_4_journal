1. How do we make a class? What code comes at the beginning?
public class Bicycle{
}

2. Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
is this a class constructor?
No, this creates an object not a class but it calls on the class contructor calling
it from class "Donut" with or by using Donut(); 

3. How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
public class Donuts{
	String icing;
	boolean isEaten;
	int layers;
	boolean numberOfCandles;
	int candles;

	public Cake(String whateverifeelike, int b){
		this.icing = whateverifeellike;
		this.isEaten = false;
		this.layers = b;

		}


} 

4. Explain in your own words - what is a getter? what does it do?
A getter gets, i.e. a getter will return a value from an object, e.g.
	public boolean getEaten()
{
		teturn this.Eaten;


}
5. What is a setter? what does it do? Give an example.
A setter sets variable value for an instance,
	public void setEaten(boolean b ){
		this.eaten = b;

}


6. What is in An array of Breakfast? How would you create one?
class ArrayBreakfast{
	public void main(String[] args) {
		breakfast[] reyesFamilyBreakfasts;

// This is not  a setter
		Cake josh = new Cake ("yellow",3)


int[] coolNumbers; // this is an array of ints
String[] befast; // this is an array of strings 
boolean[] blocked ; // this a 2d array of booleans


// this is usng a stter 

	Josh.setisEaten(true);
//this is ausing stter
	josh.getisEaten();
