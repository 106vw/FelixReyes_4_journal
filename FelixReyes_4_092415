*Ballmer believed that the gpl was a virus because of the open source neccesity there needed to be in order to use .
*an open source is a thing in which you are freely to do whatever you want !
*a proprietary software is alot more conservitive! it is for you use only not to change or modify !
*the diffrence btween a gpl and MIT is that an MIT it permits reuse within 
proprietary software provided all copies of the 
licensed software include a copy of the MIT 
License terms and the copyright notice. and a GPL 
can be distributed under the same license terms
