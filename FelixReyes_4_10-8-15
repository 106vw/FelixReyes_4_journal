what are my tentative thaughts for my art project, they are to make something colorful, 
and that sais my name as well.
what Methods will i use, i will use a fill text command saying "I am the best"
how might i use a for loop, i will use a for loop when theres a pattern involve for 
example if i print a certain letter that is numbered 2 in the alphabet i will make it blue.this would also be used in an if satement.
i will use math when it comes down to cordinates.
